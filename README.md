My name is Deniece.  I work as a Patient Experience Data Analyst at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, FL. 

I have a statistics and data analytics background.  I never liked computer science in school but I love it now. Go figure.

My faith is very important to me and is central to my life.  I'm generally and genuinely happy.
